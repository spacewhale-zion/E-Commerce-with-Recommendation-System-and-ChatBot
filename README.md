## Features

- **Product Catalog:** Browse and search a wide range of products.
- **Shopping Cart:** Easily add, update, and remove items with real-time price calculations.
- **Discount Coupons:** Validate and apply coupon codes for discounts.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Leverage a recommendation engine to suggest products based on user behavior.
- **ChatBot Integration:** An AI-powered chatbot to assist with product inquiries and support.
- **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login functionalities.
- **Order Management:** Track order history and manage purchases.
